The three "core" operations of add/delete/change can be done with the keymaps ys{motion}{char}, ds{char}, and cs{target}{replacement}, respectively. For the following examples, \* will denote the cursor position:

```
surr*ound_words ysiw) (surround_words)
*make strings ys$" "make strings"
[delete ar*ound me!] ds] delete around me!
remove <b>HTML t*ags</b> dst remove HTML tags
'change quot*es' cs'" "change quotes"
<b>or tag* types</b> csth1<CR> <h1>or tag types</h1>
delete(functi*on calls) dsf function calls
```

## delete all marks
